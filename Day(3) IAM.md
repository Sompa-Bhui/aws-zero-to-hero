# 🔐 AWS IAM (Identity & Access Management) :


## 🔹 What is IAM?

**IAM = Identity and Access Management.**  

It is a service in AWS that helps you **control who can access what** in your AWS account.  

👉 Think of IAM like a **security guard** of AWS:  
- Decides **who can enter** (users).  
- Decides **what they can do** (permissions).

## 🔹 Main Concepts in IAM

### 1. Users
- A user = one person or application who needs access.  
- Each user has a username + password or access keys.  

**Example:**  
- You and your friend work on a project.  
- You create **User A (You)** and **User B (Friend)**.  
- Each has their own login.  

---

### 2. Groups
- A group = collection of users who share the same permissions.  
- Instead of giving permissions to every user separately, you give them to the group.  

**Example:**  
- Office setup:  
  - Group = “Developers” → can access EC2 servers.  
  - Group = “Finance” → can access billing.  
- If a new developer joins, just add them to the **Developers group**.  

---

### 3. Roles
- A role = **temporary permission** given to a user or service.  
- Roles don’t have passwords.  
- They are assumed only when needed.  

**Example:**  
- An EC2 server (virtual computer) needs to read data from an S3 bucket.  
- You give the EC2 **a role** with permission “Read S3.”  
- Now the server can do the job without storing passwords.  

---

### 4. Policies & Permissions
- **Policy** = a set of rules (in JSON format) that define **what actions are allowed or denied**.  

**Example Policy:**  
- “This user can only read files from S3 bucket.”  
- “This user can start and stop EC2 servers.”  

**Real life analogy:**  
- A **key 🔑** that opens only certain rooms.  
- A user with that key cannot open all rooms, only the ones allowed.

## 🔹 Summary:-

1. **Don’t use Root Account**  
   - Root = the master account that can do everything.  
   - Use it only for creating IAM users.  

2. **Use Groups**  
   - Instead of giving permissions to each user, use groups for easy management.  

3. **Give Minimum Permissions (Least Privilege)**  
   - Always give **only the access required**.  
   - Example: Developer only needs EC2, not Billing.  

4. **Use Roles for Applications**  
   - Don’t hardcode passwords or access keys in apps.  
   - Use IAM roles to give permissions securely.  

5. **Enable MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)**  
   - Like OTP on your phone in addition to a password for extra security.

## 🔹 Real Life Example

Imagine AWS is like a big **office building**:

- **Root Account** = The Owner (has master key to every room).  
- **Users** = Employees with their own ID cards.  
- **Groups** = Departments (IT, HR, Finance).  
- **Roles** = Temporary visitor passes (for contractors, interns, or machines like EC2).  
- **Policies** = Rules written on the ID card that decide which rooms they can enter (e.g., Finance team → Finance Room only).

## ✅ Super Summary

**IAM = Security system of AWS** → Manages **WHO** can access AWS and **WHAT** they can do.
