# ☁️ AWS Basics

## 1️⃣ What is Cloud?

Cloud means using **someone else’s computer (server) through the internet** instead of keeping everything on your own computer.

- **Example 1:** Google Drive → you don’t keep files on your laptop, you keep them on Google’s servers and open them anytime.  
- **Example 2:** Netflix → movies are not on your computer, they are stored on Netflix servers (cloud).

---

## 2️⃣ Public vs Private Cloud

- **Public Cloud**: Anyone can use. You pay for what you use.  
  👉 Example: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.  
  👉 Real life: Like Ola/Uber → not your car, but you can use it when needed.

- **Private Cloud**: Made for one company only, not shared with others.  
  👉 Example: A bank creates its own private servers for storing customer data.  
  👉 Real life: Like your personal car → only you or your family use it.

---

## 3️⃣ Why Public Cloud is so Popular?

- **Cheap** → No need to buy expensive servers, just rent.  
- **Scalable** → If suddenly more people visit your website, cloud gives you more power automatically.  
- **Easy Access** → You can open it anywhere with internet.  

💡 Example:  
A startup makes an e-commerce website. Buying servers will cost lakhs of rupees. On AWS, they can start with just ₹1000–2000 per month.

---

## 4️⃣ Why AWS?

**AWS = Amazon Web Services** (biggest cloud company).

- ✅ Reliable → Amazon has huge data centers worldwide.  
- ✅ Low cost → Pay only for what you use.  
- ✅ Many services:  
  - **EC2** → Virtual computer  
  - **S3** → Storage like Google Drive  
  - **RDS** → Database  
  - Plus AI, security, networking, etc.  

💡 Example:  
Big companies like **Zomato, Flipkart, Netflix** use AWS to run their apps.

---

## 5️⃣ Why some people go back to Private Cloud?

- **Security**: Some data is very sensitive (like bank details).  
- **Cost**: If company is very big, buying their own servers may be cheaper than always paying AWS.  

💡 Example:  
Banks often keep their customer data in private cloud instead of public.

# ☁️ Cloud Types – Hybrid Cloud  

##  Hybrid Cloud  

**Definition :**  
Hybrid Cloud = **Mix of Public + Private Cloud** together.  

👉 A company uses **Public Cloud** for some work **and** **Private Cloud** for other work.  

---

### 🔹 Real Life Example  

Think of **food at home** + **food from Zomato/Swiggy**:  

- **Home food (Private Cloud):** Only your family eats, fully under your control.  
- **Swiggy/Zomato food (Public Cloud):** Anyone can order, shared service.  
- **Hybrid:** Sometimes you eat home-cooked food, sometimes you order online → you use **both together** as needed.  

---

### 🔹 IT Example  

- A **bank**:  
  - Keeps **customer transaction data** in **Private Cloud** (for security).  
  - Runs its **mobile banking app** on **Public Cloud (AWS/Azure)** to handle millions of users.  
  - Together → **Hybrid Cloud**.  

---

### 🔹 Why use Hybrid Cloud?  

1. **Flexibility** → Sensitive data in private, normal apps in public.  
2. **Cost Saving** → Don’t waste money building everything private.  
3. **Scalability** → If traffic increases, use public cloud instantly.  

---

## ✅ Super Simple Summary  

**Hybrid Cloud = Best of both worlds.**  

- **Private Cloud** = Security + Control  
- **Public Cloud** = Scalability + Low Cost  
- **Hybrid Cloud** = Use both together smartly 🚀

  # ☁️ Cloud Service Models (IaaS, SaaS, PaaS)

When we use the cloud, services are mainly divided into **3 models**:

- **IaaS → Infrastructure as a Service**
- **SaaS → Software as a Service**
- **PaaS → Platform as a Service**

👉 Think of it like **renting different levels of service in a restaurant**.

---

## 🔹 1. IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

**Definition :**  
IaaS gives you the **basic building blocks** — virtual machines, storage, and networking.  
You manage the OS, apps, and data yourself.

**Real Life Example:**  

- Like renting a **plot of land** 🏡.  
- The landlord gives land + water + electricity (infrastructure).  
- You build your own house, design rooms, and decide how to use it.  

**IT Example:**  

- AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure VM.  
- You get a **virtual server** → install your own OS, apps, and manage security.  

**Who uses it?**  

- Developers who want **full control** of the system.  
- Startups hosting websites on cloud VMs.  

---

## 🔹 2. SaaS (Software as a Service)

**Definition :**  
SaaS gives you **ready-to-use software** over the internet.  
You don’t manage servers, OS, or code. Just log in and use.  

**Real Life Example:**  

- Like staying in a **hotel** 🏨.  
- Everything is ready (room, food, cleaning).  
- You just enjoy the service and pay.  

**IT Example:**  

- Gmail, Google Drive, Zoom, Netflix.  
- You don’t care where servers are → you just use the app.  

**Who uses it?**  

- End users (students, companies, everyone).  

---

## 🔹 3. PaaS (Platform as a Service)

**Definition :**  
PaaS gives you a **ready-made platform** (OS + runtime + tools) to build and run apps.  
You just focus on coding, not server setup.

**Real Life Example:**  

- Like renting a **fully-built apartment** 🏢.  
- The builder provides walls, electricity, water, furniture (platform).  
- You just move in, decorate, and live.  

**IT Example:**  

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Microsoft Azure App Service.  
- You write code → upload → platform runs it (manages scaling, updates).  

**Who uses it?**  

- Developers who don’t want to waste time on server setup.  
- Teams building apps quickly without managing infrastructure.  

---

## 🔹 Visual Analogy (Restaurant 🍽️)

- **IaaS:** You cook everything yourself → restaurant gives raw kitchen + stove + ingredients.  
- **SaaS:** Restaurant serves you a ready-to-eat meal.  
- **PaaS:** Restaurant gives semi-cooked food → you just add spices and finish cooking.

| Who manages?      | You manage OS + apps                   | Provider manages everything | Provider manages infra, you manage code             |
| Real Life Analogy | Renting land to build house            | Staying in hotel            | Renting ready apartment                             |
| Examples          | AWS EC2, Azure VM, GCP Compute         | Gmail, Netflix, Zoom        | AWS Beanstalk, Google App Engine, Azure App Service |

---

## ✅ Super Simple Summary

- **IaaS → You rent raw resources.** (Like land)  
- **SaaS → You use ready-made software.** (Like hotel stay)  
- **PaaS → You rent a platform.** (Like an apartment)
