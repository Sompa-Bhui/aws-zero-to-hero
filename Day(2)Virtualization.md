# 🖥️ Virtualization

## 🔹 What is Virtualization?

**Definition :**  
Virtualization means creating a **virtual (not physical)** version of something — like a computer, storage, or network — using software.  

👉 In short:  
It allows **one physical machine** (like a big server) to run **multiple small virtual machines (VMs)** inside it.

## 🔹 Real Life Example 1: Apartment Building

- Big **house** = Physical server  
- Many **flats** = Virtual machines  
- Different families live in different flats (each VM runs its own OS and apps)  
- All still share the **same building resources** (electricity, water, space → CPU, RAM, storage)

## 🔹 Real Life Example 2: School Bus

- One big **school bus** = Server hardware  
- Many **students** = Virtual machines  
- All share the **same bus engine, fuel, driver** (CPU, memory, hardware)  
- But each student is separate (each VM works independently)

## 🔹 Why is Virtualization Important?

1. 💰 **Cost Saving** – Instead of buying 10 separate computers, buy 1 powerful computer and make 10 VMs inside it.  
2. ⚡ **Better Resource Use** – Physical servers are often underused. Virtualization uses CPU, RAM, storage more efficiently.  
3. 🔄 **Flexibility** – Easily create, delete, or move a VM.  
4. 🔒 **Isolation** – Even if one VM crashes, others keep working.

## 🔹 Where is Virtualization Used?

- **Cloud Computing (AWS, Azure, GCP):** Virtualization is the backbone. AWS runs thousands of VMs for different customers on the same hardware.  
- **Developers:** Use tools like **VMware, VirtualBox** to run Linux and Windows on the same laptop.  
- **Companies:** Instead of 50 physical servers, they buy 5 powerful servers and run 50 VMs inside.

## ✅ Summary

**Virtualization = Dividing one big computer into many small computers using software.**

## 🔹 Types of Virtualization

- **Hardware Virtualization** → Many computers inside one big computer.  
- **OS Virtualization** → Many apps inside one OS (containers).  
- **Storage Virtualization** → Many disks look like one big disk.  
- **Network Virtualization** → One network becomes many virtual networks.  
- **Desktop Virtualization** → Your desktop runs remotely on a server.
