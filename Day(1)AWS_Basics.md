# ☁️ AWS Basics for Beginners

This guide explains **Cloud Computing and AWS** in very simple English with real-life examples.  

---

## 1️⃣ What is Cloud?

Cloud means using **someone else’s computer (server) through the internet** instead of keeping everything on your own computer.

- **Example 1:** Google Drive → you don’t keep files on your laptop, you keep them on Google’s servers and open them anytime.  
- **Example 2:** Netflix → movies are not on your computer, they are stored on Netflix servers (cloud).

## 2️⃣ Public vs Private Cloud

- **Public Cloud**: Anyone can use. You pay for what you use.  
  👉 Example: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.  
  👉 Real life: Like Ola/Uber → not your car, but you can use it when needed.

- **Private Cloud**: Made for one company only, not shared with others.  
  👉 Example: A bank creates its own private servers for storing customer data.  
  👉 Real life: Like your personal car → only you or your family use it.

## 3️⃣ Why Public Cloud is so Popular?

- **Cheap** → No need to buy expensive servers, just rent.  
- **Scalable** → If suddenly more people visit your website, cloud gives you more power automatically.  
- **Easy Access** → You can open it anywhere with internet.  

💡 Example:  
A startup makes an e-commerce website. Buying servers will cost lakhs of rupees. On AWS, they can start with just ₹1000–2000 per month.

## 4️⃣ Why AWS?

**AWS = Amazon Web Services** (biggest cloud company).

- ✅ Reliable → Amazon has huge data centers worldwide.  
- ✅ Low cost → Pay only for what you use.  
- ✅ Many services:  
  - **EC2** → Virtual computer  
  - **S3** → Storage like Google Drive  
  - **RDS** → Database  
  - Plus AI, security, networking, etc.  

💡 Example:  
Big companies like **Zomato, Flipkart, Netflix** use AWS to run their apps.

## 5️⃣ Why some people go back to Private Cloud?

- **Security**: Some data is very sensitive (like bank details).  
- **Cost**: If company is very big, buying their own servers may be cheaper than always paying AWS.  

💡 Example:  
Banks often keep their customer data in private cloud instead of public.
